# Sapma
Sapma is a game for the Acerola Jam 0. Sapma is just a word for "Aberration" which is the theme of the game jam. Sapma uses aberration theme as kind of an anti-game. A video game is generally a curated experience where every feature is perfectly controlled for the experience. In Sapma most of the features are random. Look of the game, what the player can do, what exists in the game etc.
